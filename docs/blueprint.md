# **App Name**: TestWise AI

## Core Features:

- AI Model Visualization: A well-designed UI to showcase the inputs and outputs of the AI model, and its inner workings. Clear data representation is crucial.
- Diverse Input Testing: Capability to expose a range of diverse inputs to the model, so the presenter can probe model behavior.
- Test Logging: Logging of results to track AI performance under different test conditions.
- Qualitative Feedback Tool: A feedback mechanism to provide qualitative assessments (e.g., "Acceptable," "Needs Improvement," "Unacceptable") for each output.
- Automated Pattern Recognition: Automatic summarization of log file. Using a generative AI tool, summarize recurring patterns to facilitate analysis of model failure.
- Result Summary: Summary cards indicating categories or failure for each test iteration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) for calmness and reliability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD) for a clean interface.
- Accent color: Soft green (#81C784) for indicating success or improvement.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable look.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different test scenarios and outcomes.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to indicate state changes and test progress.
